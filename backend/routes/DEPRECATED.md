# ⚠️ DEPRECATED DIRECTORY

> **This directory is part of the LEGACY architecture.**

All routes in this directory are being migrated to `/backend/src/api/routes/`.

## DO NOT:
- Add new routes here
- Modify existing routes (unless fixing critical bugs)
- Import from these files in new code

## Instead:
- Add new routes to `/backend/src/api/routes/`
- Import routes from the new location

## Migration Status
Routes are being migrated feature by feature. See `/backend/MIGRATION_NOTES.md` for details.

## Removal Timeline
These files will be removed after production is confirmed stable with the new architecture.
